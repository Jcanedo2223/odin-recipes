    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Growing up with my grandma the kitchen was filled with the aroma of her famous blackberry cobbler. When she passed away she shared the recipe with only me. For years I kept the recipe a secret. I am finally ready to share it all with you.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>6 tbsp cold butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 cups blackberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 F. Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in 1/4 cup boiling water until mixture is evenly moist</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in cold water. Mix in remaining 1 cup sugar, lemon juice, and blackberries. Transfer to a cast iron skillet and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Drop dough into the skillet by spoonfuls. Place skillet on the foil lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li> Bake 25 minutes until dough is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
